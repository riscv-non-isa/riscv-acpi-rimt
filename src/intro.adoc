== Introduction

The RISC-V IO Mapping Table (RIMT)  provides information about the RISC-V IOMMU
cite:[IOMMU-SPEC] and the relationship between the IO topology and the IOMMU in
ACPI cite:[ACPI-SPEC] based RISC-V platforms. The RIMT identifies which
components are backing IOMMU and how they are connected together. RISC-V IOMMU
can be implemented as either a PCIe device or a platform device.
