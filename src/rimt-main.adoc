== RISC-V IO Mapping Table (RIMT)

The <<rimt>> shows the structure of RIMT. Apart from the basic header, RIMT can contain several
nodes. Each node represents a component, which can be an IOMMU, a PCIe root complex, or a platform
device.

=== RIMT node structure types
RIMT node structures can be broadly classified as two types: one is the actual IOMMU node
structure and the other is the device node structure for devices bound to an IOMMU. The device node
structure can be further classified as PCIe root complex and platform device structures bound to an IOMMU. For example,
in a system with a single IOMMU, RIMT should have at least two nodes. One for the IOMMU itself
and another for the devices behind this particular IOMMU. <<rimt_node_structure>> lists possible
types for those structures.

==== IOMMU Node
The IOMMU can be implemented as a platform device or as a PCIe device. The IOMMU node is
the structure in RIMT used to report the configuration and capabilities of each IOMMU in the system.

|===

The ID mapping structure provides information about how devices are connected to an IOMMU. The devices can be
natively identified by a source ID, but the platform can use a remapped ID to identify transactions from the
device to the IOMMU.

For PCIe devices, source ID is the 16-bit triplet of PCIe bus number (8-bit), device number (5-bit), and
function number (3-bit) (collectively known as routing identifier or RID). A range of source IDs must map to a
single IOMMU only. If there are multiple root complexes with the same PCIe segment number, then their source
ID ranges must not overlap. For each ACPI device object of the root complex that belongs to the same PCIe
segment, the firmware must include the Device Specific Method (_DSM), Function Index 5, for preserving boot
configurations as defined by the PCI Firmware Specification cite:[PCI-FW-SPEC]. The _DSM method must return
zero to indicate that the Operating System must preserve PCIe resource assignments made by the firmware at
boot time.

For platform devices, source ID is the implementation specific ID and managed by the device driver. Each ID mapping
array entry provides a mapping from a range of source IDs to the corresponding device IDs that will be used at
the input to the IOMMU. See <<Mapping-Examples>> for an example of ID mapping structures.

==== Platform Device Node
There may be non-PCIe platform devices that are enumerated by using Differentiated System Description
Table(DSDT). These devices can have one or more source IDs in the mapping table, but they can have
their own scheme to define the source IDs. Hence, those source IDs can be unique to only the ACPI
platform device. The interpretation of those source IDs is expected to be managed by the platform
device's device driver.
